# ObserBN
ObserBN: Observability Analysis Software Package for Boolean Networks

Based on the undirected graphs, two fundamental observable styles and two unobservable
styles are proposed for an arbitrary Boolean network. In order to facilitate more users, a user
friendly toolbox named ’ObserBN’ has been proposed. For any Boolean networks with arbitrary
number of nodes and Boolean functions, users are only required to provide the logic expressions
of dynamic network and sensors, the observability can be determined efficiently.
